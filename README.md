# quiz-game
<pre>
I made this project based on a youtube tutorial and added some new features to it

The tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=1126s

The features i added:
    -I added a category selector so now you can choose in which topic you want to get questions
        -after you finished the quiz, not restart the only option but you can to the category
        selector if you want

   - My version counts the questions the user answered and shows it 
   -it counts your score and shows continuously
   
   -it keeps track of Best Scores and shows it at the end of the quiz
   -it shows you when you have a new Best score
   (does not save best scores, if you refresh the page, -maybe later I add this feature)

    -not only do the questions come in random order but the answers too
